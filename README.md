## Background

See in progress spec: https://did-coop.github.io/wallet-attached-storage-spec/

### App Identity and Key Management

To use Wallet Attached Storage (to provision data spaces, to create collections,
and to read and write resources), the application or service using this client
will need its own cryptographically provable identity (in the form of a
[DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)).

At minimum, this means that the app or service using this client will need to
create and manage its own public-private key pair. The challenges and security
considerations of cryptographic key management are beyond the scope of this
usage document, but roughly:

* For in browser **client-only Single Page Applications** (SPAs), the app's
  identity is ephemeral -- essentially a key pair will be generated for each
  new user session, and stored in the browser.

* For traditional **server side web applications**, it is recommended that the
  app's DID and key pairs are managed securely, on the server side, preferably
  using an HSM (Hardware Security Module).

* For **mobile apps**, key pairs may be generated during setup, and can take
  advantage of the mobile operating system's keychain and encrypted app storage.

## Security

TBD

## Install

- Node.js 18+ is recommended.

### NPM

To install via NPM:

```
npm install @did-coop/wallet-attached-storage
```

### Development

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/did-coop/wallet-attached-storage.git
cd wallet-attached-storage
npm install
```

## Usage

This client assumes:

* a remote Wallet Attached Storage server is available
* the app is able to create and store a public-private key pair, see the
  [App Identity and Key Management](#app-identity-and-key-management) section
  for more details.

Example key pair generation (for an in-browser SPA), for persistence in local
storage.

```ts
import { Ed25519Signer } from '@did.coop/did-key-ed25519'

const appDidSigner = await Ed25519Signer.generate()
```

Example storing and loading:

```ts
// Serialize to JSON for storage
const exportedKeyPair = appDidSigner.toJSON()
localStorage.setItem('app-DID', JSON.stringify(exportedKeyPair))

// Load from storage and turn back into a DID Signer
const loadedKeyPair = localStorage.getItem('app-DID')
const appDidSigner = Ed25519Signer.fromJSON(loadedKeyPair)
```

Create a Wallet Attached Storage Client:

```ts
import { WasClient } from '@did-coop/wallet-attached-storage'

const config = {
  was: {
    url: 'https://data.pub'
  }
}

const storage = new WasClient({ url: config.was.url, signer: appDidSigner })
```

Provision (create and set up) a Data Space (this performs a [Create Space HTTP
API operation](https://did-coop.github.io/wallet-attached-storage-spec/#create-space-operation)):

```ts
let space
try {
  space = await storage.space()
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Error initializing data space:', e)
  throw e
}
```

Now you can read and write resources to and from collections:

```ts
// Create a request to list the contents of the 'credentials' collection
const cursor = space.collection('credentials').list()

// Iterate through the results
for await (const vc of cursor) {
  console.log(vc);
}
// or cast the results to an array
const allItems = await cursor.toArray()

// Write a VC to a collection
const { url } = await space.collection('credentials').put(myVc)
```
